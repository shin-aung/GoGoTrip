      "title": "AI & Automation",
      "questionOne": {
        "question": "How can AI agents help my small or medium business?",
        "answer": "AI agents can handle customer support inquiries 24/7, answering common questions, resolving simple issues, and escalating complex matters to human agents when necessary. This improves customer satisfaction through instant responses while reducing support costs. Our clients have successfully implemented AI agents for appointment scheduling, product recommendations, and routine service requests—allowing their teams to focus on high-value interactions that build lasting customer relationships."
      },
      "questionTwo": {
        "question": "What are automated AI workflows and how do they solve real business problems?",
        "answer": "Automated AI workflows connect multiple systems and processes with intelligent decision-making capabilities. Common implementations include streamlining approval processes that previously took days into minutes, automatically categorizing and routing customer inquiries to the right department, and processing routine transactions without human intervention. These workflows eliminate bottlenecks, reduce human error, and free up your team to focus on strategic work."
      },
      "questionThree": {
        "question": "What enterprise AI solutions are most valuable for improving operational efficiency?",
        "answer": "Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) is transforming how businesses handle paperwork by automatically extracting and processing information from forms, invoices, contracts, and reports. This reduces manual data entry and accelerates document handling. Internal AI chatbots are also highly effective, handling routine HR and IT inquiries such as policy questions, password resets, and system access requests—improving employee experience while reducing support ticket volume."
      },
      "questionFour": {
        "question": "How do you ensure AI systems integrate seamlessly with our existing technology?",
        "answer": "We take an integration-first approach to AI implementation. Before development begins, we map your current technology ecosystem and identify optimal connection points. Our solutions use industry-standard APIs and middleware when available, and we develop custom connectors when needed. We also implement robust monitoring to ensure your AI systems work harmoniously with existing platforms as both evolve over time."

      "title": "Custom Software Development",
      "questionOne": {
        "question": "How long does it typically take to build a custom application?",
        "answer": "Project timelines vary based on complexity and scope. An MVP can typically be launched within 2-3 months, while more comprehensive solutions may require 4-6 months. During our initial consultation, we'll provide a detailed timeline based on your specific requirements."
      },
      "questionTwo": {
        "question": "Do you provide support after the project is completed?",
        "answer": "Yes, we offer ongoing maintenance and support services to ensure your solution continues to perform optimally. Many clients choose to retain our services for continued enhancements and scaling as their business grows."
      },
      "questionThree": {
        "question": "What technologies does Onify use to build custom applications?",
        "answer": "We leverage proven technologies and building blocks like Medusa, .NET, Node.JS, Python, n8n, and Supabase to speed up development time while ensuring scalability and security. By using established frameworks where appropriate, we reduce development risks and costs while maintaining the flexibility to create truly custom solutions tailored to your unique business needs."

We'll recommend the most appropriate structure after understanding your specific requirements during our initial consultation."
      },
